    "PPG-DaLiA is a public wearable physiology dataset for **wrist PPG-based heart rate estimation under motion**. It includes recordings from **15 subjects** performing a range of real-life activities, with **ECG-derived heart rate** as ground truth. The Zenodo **PPGDalia** variant used here is a **benchmark-ready export**: it is **pre-segmented into windows** and distributed in a standardized time-series regression format (the `.ts` format). Signals in this benchmark version are provided as ML-ready time series (segmented and typically normalized/standardized for benchmarking), and the `.ts` files do not preserve physical sensor units.\n",
