    "Goal: build a **clean, reproducible sleep-staging pipeline** from **wrist ACC + HR** aligned to **PSG-scored 30-second epochs**, with **leakage-aware, subject-wise evaluation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we do:   \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the modeling unit as the PSG epoch (30s)** and build one feature row per epoch.  \n",
    "2. **Align** wrist **ACC** and **HR** to each labeled 30s epoch (aggregate samples falling in `[t, t+30s)`), and attach the PSG stage label at `t`.  \n",
    "3. **Extract simple, readable features** per epoch:   \n",
    "   - ACC: magnitude and axis statistics + activity intensity proxies  \n",
    "   - HR: summary statistics + missingness indicators  \n",
    "4. Add **causal context (history) features** using past-only rolling summaries over recent epochs (e.g., last few minutes) to capture local sleep continuity without using future information.  \n",
    "5. Train and compare a small set of classical models using **subject-wise cross-validation** (GroupKFold) and report robust staging metrics (macro-F1, balanced accuracy, confusion matrices, per-subject performance).  \n",
    "6. Apply a lightweight **temporal stabilization** step (e.g., hysteresis / causal smoothing of probabilities) to reduce one-epoch “blips” and reflect product-realistic output stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note on extra “pre-PSG” wearable data:\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset includes wearable streams that may start **before PSG time zero** (e.g., steps for days prior, HR for hours prior, motion shortly before). For the main staging pipeline we **restrict to the PSG-labeled interval** and only aggregate sensor data within labeled 30s epochs. Pre-PSG data can be used in extensions as **subject-level context** (e.g., prior-days activity summaries computed strictly from `t < 0`), but coverage varies across subjects and adds preprocessing complexity.\n"
